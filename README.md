This code was written in 2012/2013.  I just checked it (Aug 2018) and it won't build with the current configuration.  Once the config was tweaked to get past that problem I ran into what appears to be something that has changed in the Scala language.  I am on the fence as to whether it is worth updating, but in the meantime it is worth reviewing as once working code.

pegpuzzle
=========

Finger exercise for learning Scala.  Solve the triangle peg puzzle.

Next steps:

* Add concurrency via actors
* See if structure can be changed to better support memoization

I needed a project to get started learning Scala.  I thought this puzzle might
be a place to begin.  So far it has raised a few more questions than I had
expected.  Which is good.
